# PathogenSensing




Bacterial Sensor - 3D FEM Simulation Evaluator

------------------------

This Matlab Code can evaluate arbitrary 3D FEM simulations for the purpose of bacterial/ pathogen sensing. It can be used to find optimal geometrical design and layout.

Electrical field gradients are calculated and sorted into a histogram which then can be further processed. An arithmetic mean can predict how big electricalal forces are on a bacterial model (in 2D and 3D).

Input required: .csv files (created with COMSOL FEM simulation tool)
